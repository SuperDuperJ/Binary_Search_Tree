# Binary_Search_Tree

Herein is a binary search tree that I created from scratch using Python. I learned about BSTs in a Codecademy course on Data Structures and Algorithms.  

The __init__, insert, get_node_by_value, and in_order_traversal methods were a part of the course.

The remaining methods are entirely my own work.

This project is not finished.
